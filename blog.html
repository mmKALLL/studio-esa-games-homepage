          <h2>Shortcomings of Against the Storm</h2>

            <p>Slipways and AtS both seem very promising in delivering meaningful strategic decisions, but (despite being fantastic games) they ultimately fall short of my ideal in that regard. Compared to Slipways, in AtS I like that you get bonuses for going above and beyond and truly have multiple wincons. Having all wincons contribute to the same stat is also interesting: switching approaches mid-run doesn't mean throwing away all your progress.</p>

            <p>However, it still feels overly complex: having to learn and track the upgrade tree and seal missions detracts from the new player experience, and the differences between runs are typically not great enough to force the player out of heuristic decision-making. Worst of all, it still feels like a slog to go through, with some runs lasting over an hour and punishment waiting at every corner. It's not a pleasant experience - and the game makes this expectation clear - but it's clearly lacking the _joy_ that Japanese game designers so deeply understand.</p>
            
            <p>I'm certain the format is possible to squeeze into an exciting 15-minute mobile game, but this is not the way to go. Tacking on a city builder "frontend" on top of the number-driven mechanics presents many of the same fundamental problems that made me dislike EU4. I want to play something where _every_ decision is meaningful, precise, and optimizable, not something where the "interface" to the underlying mechanics forces the designers to provide a lot of leeway.</p>

            <p>I should also mention the low initial skill ceiling from artificially locked difficulty. StS and RoR don't need level-up unlocks, but it's absolutely essential for hiding the "unnecessary" complexity of AtS. Thankfully the difficulties ramp up quickly, but the stakes are also too high: one failed run can erase hours of progress. Initially I liked pushing my luck in a Majora's Mask esque world, but it quickly became frustrating as I find myself picking easier difficulties in order to make progress through the seals. Even then Viceroy difficulty feels way too easy, but the game really doesn't want me to feel comfortable about trying prestige runs before they're necessary.</p>
            
            <p>I'm sure I'll discover a lot of things about myself when I eventually venture into the higher difficulties, but given the time investment I'm not sure if I want to. In general, I'm a fan of taking time to ponder a difficult decision; relishing in the anguish of tradeoffs. I love the cornerstone and blueprint decisions (and they are very similar to Alignment is Hard's core gameplay loop), but everything else feels like filler. Especially the real-time nature of AtS detracts from this: if Slipways was able to deliver the premise even slightly more elegantly, my ideal game would exist.</p>
            
            <p>Since I haven't found a game that truly reaches that ideal, I shall continue the development for Alignment is Hard. However, I find it far more joyful to discover that someone else has already created the game I want to play: let me know if you know a game that does things better!</p>
            
            
            
            Glossary:
            
            <ul>
              <li>AtS = Against the Storm</li>
              <li>wincon = victory condition</li>
              <li>meaningful strategic decision = decision between 2-4 options with very asymmetric benefits/drawbacks, which force a different playstyle if picked, which are balanced enough that the player can't have an obvious/heuristic choice, but which are unbalanced enough that there's at least one clear mistake compared to the optimal choice given perfect play (Slay the Spire and Elona Shooter do this the best. I should write a separate post about the topic, since I've been mulling it for over two years.) </li>
